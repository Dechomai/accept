## Accept
Accept is a service running on the Ethereum network, serving as a peer-to-peer marketplace allowing users to exchange goods and services. It connects a network of traders around the globe through blockchain technology to make trading safer and more cost-effective for all parties. Accept users will be able to trade securely, privately, and anonymously in the Accept global marketplace â€“ or locally in independent nodes - we are building a self-regulated and open-source platform, maintained and improved by its users.

Supported by Dechomai and a network of global affiliates, we are proudly open source - we need as many smart people working together on this as possible.
